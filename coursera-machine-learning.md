Session 2016-09-12 -> 2016-11-21

The course introduce the core ideas of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data.
We need to learn some octave programming for the course's exercises. 

The core ideas
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regrssion
- Neural Networks
- Machine Learning System Design
- Support Vector Machines
- Unsupervised Learning
- Dimensional Reducion
- Anomaly Detection
- Recommander Systems
- Large Scale machine Learning
- Photo OCR

Summary: Main topics

Supervised Learning
- Linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, SVMs.

Unsupervised Learning
K-means, PCA, Anomaly Detection

Special applications/special topics
